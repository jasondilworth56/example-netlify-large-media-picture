# Example: Netlify Large Media and picture

This is an example site to demonstrate the use of Netlify Large Media for managing source image assets and serving image transformations on-the-fly to populate different source images in picture elements.


## Instructions

To get your own instance of this 11ty starter project cloned and deploying to Netlify very quickly, just click the button below and follow the instructions.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/philhawksworth/example-netlify-large-media-picture)


## Wait, what happens when I click that button?

Good question. Here's what it will do...

1. Netlify will clone the git repository of this project into your Github account. It will be asking for permission to add the repo for you.
2. We'll create a new site for you in Netlify, and configure it to use your shiny new repo. Right away you'll be able to deploy changes simply by pushing changes to your repo.
3. That's it really.


## Local development

- [Node](https://nodejs.org) - to run the build
